        "Now that we have a trained model, we can generate some restaurant descriptions! Fill in the function below to generate a resturant description from an input list of meaning representations (strings). As before, you want to run the input through the encoder, then set up the decoder and run the decoder loop, generating the highest (log) probability word at each iteration (ie. greedy decoding); you should be able to reuse some of your code from `train()`. The key differences from `train()` are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- You should wrap the entire contents of this function with a `with` statement that sets `torch.no_grad()`. This will tell PyTorch that it doesn't need to keep track of the computation graph values and gradients. Since we aren't doing parameter updates anymore, we don't need the gradients, so telling PyTorch to skip calculating them will make this function run faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In the decoder loop, you should stop generating words and return if the end meta-token is generated before `max_length` is reached; otherwise, you should generate `max_length` words and then return. Don't include the start meta-token or the end meta-token, if generated, in the returned list of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The return type of this function is a list of strings, but decoder predicts a tensor containing an index into the target vocabulary. You will need to first convert this tensor into an int using `Tensor.item()`, and then convert the int into a word using the `torchtext` dictionary `tgt_vocab.itos` (\"index to string\").\n",
